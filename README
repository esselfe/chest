The chest program can be used to encrypt and decrypt files using a password
hash hopping algorithm. Note that the encrypted output may be vulnerable to
hash database cracking due to its simplicity.

Just give a filename as argument and it should detect, according to the
presence of the .chest extension, whether to encrypt or decrypt.

Neither the password or the hash are stored in the output file, the hash is
generated at runtime after the user has been asked for a password.

Disclaimer: There is no warranty that the encrypted output file is not
crackable! Normally you shouldn't store critical data with this encryption.
See the LICENSE file for full disclosure.

Enjoy!
